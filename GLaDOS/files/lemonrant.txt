All right, I've been thinking, when life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade!
Make life take the lemons back!
Get mad!
I don't want your damn lemons!
What am I supposed to do with these?
Demand to see life's manager!
Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons!
Do you know who I am?
I'm the man whose gonna burn your house down - with the lemons!
